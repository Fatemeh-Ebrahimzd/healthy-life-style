                    <br>
                    Jurgen Klopp shocked everyone yesterday. The German coach confirmed that he will leave Liverpool at the end of the season and after 9 years, and will not accept the leadership of any national team or club until the summer of 2025.
                    Klopp also emphasized that he will not manage any team in England other than Liverpool, even if he is starving. In this way, the future of the club will be outside of England.

                <p><mark>The most expensive players of the Asian Nations Cup</mark>; A 22-year-old is in the lead/ There is no news about Iran's football stars!
                    <br>
                    The fact that Iran does not have a representative in this list is one thing, and the fact that we lack players under 25 in our team is another thing. In Iranian football, due to lack of attention to the basic teams, new players are introduced after 25 years, and we know that in world football, no team invests in such players. Right now, many clubs don't want our "Mehdi Tarimi" just because of his old age. While he is at the peak of preparation, experience and maturity, now look at how many players under the age of 25 do you know in our league who have the possibility of becoming a legionnaire?
